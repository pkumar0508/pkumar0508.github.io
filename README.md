====================

This is the repository for my public Github Pages website.

It is currently in under development. I simply use CommonMark to generate the HTML, which
I'll have to pretty up and organize with Bootstrap soon.
[Chisel](https://github.com/dz/chisel) also looks interesting, so I may play around with that.

You can view it at [pkumar0508.github.io](http://pkumar0508.github.io)
