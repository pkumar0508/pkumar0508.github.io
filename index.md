This webpage is currently under development, and I am looking forward to showcasing my coding work here.

Coding
--------
I have interests and experience in the technological, scientific, and financial domains. To keep up with the state of code, I spend time on Stack Overflow

I enjoy coding in Python and practiced doing so on Project Euler problems. 
They have a lot of fun number theory problems, and due to the numeric nature of the problems,
I have been able to use Numpy to accelerate my solutions.

In addition, I have also brushed up on C++ using the Timus Online Judge. 
Most of the [problems that I have solved](http://acm.timus.ru/author.aspx?id=133552) on 
that site are on the easy side to just get used to the site. Problem #1220 "Stacks" required
a bit of extra thinking about the overhead incurred at the lower level with respect to class design.

Data Science
------------

While my research work at Pitt was using statistical mechanical molecular modeling techniques in surface science
and have analyzed scientific simulation data, I have developed an interest in
the machine learning approach to statistical analysis. I have recently finished Andrew Ng's
[Machine learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml).
In addition, I am taking [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn) and
[Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod) from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera and
will soon have Shiny app to demo here!

In Progress ....
----------------

Check out my [github](https://github.com/pkumar0508). This website is hosted using Github Pages.  
I will have a link to my resume here soon.

Demos and links to my work will appear here soon. You can expect

- Diffusion limited aggregation snowflakes in a Java applet
- Finite difference solver for option valuation in Matlab
- Project Euler solution samples
- Resume LaTeX source
- and more!
