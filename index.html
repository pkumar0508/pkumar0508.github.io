<h1>Prashant Kumar</h1>
<p>This webpage is currently under development, and I am looking forward to showcasing my coding work here.</p>
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>I have interests and experience in the technological, scientific, and financial domains. To keep up with the state of code, I spend time on Stack Overflow</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/498705/prashant-kumar">

<p>I enjoy coding in Python and practiced doing so on Project Euler problems.
They have a lot of fun number theory problems, and due to the numeric nature of the problems,
I have been able to use Numpy to accelerate my solutions.</p>
<p><img src="https://projecteuler.net/profile/Yoshis88.png" alt="69+ problems solved" /></p>
<p>In addition, I have also brushed up on C++ using the Timus Online Judge.
Most of the <a href="https://acm.timus.ru/author.aspx?id=133552">problems that I have solved</a> on
that site are on the easy side to just get used to the site. Problem #1220 &quot;Stacks&quot; required
a bit of extra thinking about the overhead incurred at the lower level with respect to class design.</p>
<h2>Data Science</h2>
<p>While my research work at Pitt was using statistical mechanical molecular modeling techniques in surface science
and have analyzed scientific simulation data, I have developed an interest in
the machine learning approach to statistical analysis. I have recently finished Andrew Ng's
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Machine learning course on Coursera</a>.
In addition, I am taking <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn">Practical Machine Learning</a> and
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod">Developing Data Products</a> from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera and
will soon have Shiny app to demo here!</p>
<h2>In Progress ....</h2>
<p>Check out my <a href="https://github.com/pkumar0508">github</a>. This website is hosted using Github Pages.<br />
I will have a link to my resume here soon.</p>
<p>Demos and links to my work will appear here soon. You can expect</p>
<ul>
<li>Diffusion limited aggregation snowflakes in a Java applet</li>
<li>Finite difference solver for option valuation in Matlab</li>
<li>Project Euler solution samples</li>
<li>Resume LaTeX source</li>
<li>and more!</li>
</ul>
